## Novelty
1) Combines five different disease identification workflows on the website to make a dashboard to check for various types of diseases all at one place.

2) Trained different models for different diseases according to need and accuracy. For heart disease and breast cancer- bagging classifier is used, for malaria- keras sequential model, for pneumonia- vgg16 and for liver disease- randomforestclassifier.

3) Applied feature engineering to drop unwanted features, handle missing values, handle categorical features, handle feature scaling, remove outliers, explore the Correlation between numerical features, find relation between features and labels. This led to reduced mean squared error of the algorithm without increasing the complexity of the model.



<!-- ## Heart Disease
The Heart Disease dataset has been taken from Kaggle. This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. It has a total number of 303 rows and 14 columns among which 165 have a heart disease.<br />
*Data Source:* [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

## Liver Disease
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.<br />

## Breast CancerThis dataset consists of 569 rows and 33 columns.<br />
*Data Source:* [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

## Malaria Disease
The dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells.<br />
*Data Source:* [Malaria Dataset](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932)

## Pneumonia Disease
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert. There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).<br />
